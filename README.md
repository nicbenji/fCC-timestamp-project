https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/timestamp-microservice

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

    Clone this GitHub repo and complete your project locally.
    Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

Note: Time zones conversion is not a purpose of this project, so assume all sent valid dates will be parsed with new Date() as GMT dates.
